### **Cats Are Cats But Their Eyes Are Charge-Rifles And Their Claws Are Power Claws And They Regenerate**
(*fully compatible with Erin's Cats*)

#### **Mod Features:**

1. **Cats Are Cats:**
   - These cats may have charge-rifle eyes and power claws, but at their core, they’re still cats. They’ll purr, nuzzle, knock things off shelves, and curl up on your bed. The only difference is that when danger strikes, they’re ready to hunt, stalk, and pounce in the playful way we love to watch.
  
2. **Claws Damage Slider:**
   - Adjust the power of your cats' claws to suit your playstyle. Whether you prefer the cozy safety of a regular cat or want a feline defender capable of dishing out the damage of an Antigrain Warhead, the choice is yours:
     - **"Deadly" (Minimum):** The familiar RimWorld cat claw damage.
     - **"Power Claw" (Default):** A boost in strength, making these cats formidable melee fighters.
     - **"Antigrain IED" (Maximum):** For when you want your cats to deliver truly explosive results—eight times the power of a Power Claw.
  
3. **Charge-Rifle Eyes:**
   - Your cat can finally get that bird just out of reach. Don’t worry, though—they won’t be firing lasers during nap time. If you prefer your cats to stick to their claws, you can toggle this feature off in the mod settings.

4. **Regeneration:**
   - Just like their nine lives suggest, these cats have remarkable regenerative abilities. They’ll heal from injuries over time, ensuring they’re always ready for a little more adventure—or just another cozy nap.

5. **Replaces RimWorld Vanilla Cats:**
   - This mod replaces the default RimWorld cat. Acquire them any way you get regular cats to join your colony—through traders, events, or taming wild ones.  
   - The original, non-enhanced cats will still be available from exotic pet traders, labeled as "Ornamental Cats." These are your standard, unarmed variety—perfect for those who just want a pet without all the extra firepower.

6. **Training and Charm:**
   - Train your cats. Stop laughing, I'm serious. These cats can be trained to follow and attack. But cats are cats, demanding attention, lounging around, and occasionally knocking over your carefully placed items. Whether they’re snuggling up to your colonists or standing by to defend the colony, they never lose that quintessential cat charm.

7. **Modular Danger:**
   - While these cats are loving companions, it's best to remember that a cat is still a cat—and may appear in manhunter events. *Caveat emptor.*
